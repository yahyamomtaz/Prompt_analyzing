This is the initial python code to be updated:

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart save it to an image in temp_chart.png and do not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:

User 1: give me a summary of dataset

This is the initial python code to be updated:
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart save it to an image in temp_chart.png and do not show the chart.)
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": "The highest salary is $9,000." }
